- Write project reports in markdown and style with css, so that all your reports have consitent styling and you are focused more on content creation.
- Users new to markdown format can play with this app to get a hang of its capability.

Additional fun features of this application are -

##### Application References

This application uses two major chunks in its implementation, as follows.

1. **Ace Editor** - [shinyAce](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyAce) is a R package wrapper to implement the live text editor input section.
2. [**knitr**](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) - R package to convert markdown documents to various formats such as - .docx, .ppt, HTML, ioslides among a few other. Here, we specifically knit it to HTML for live preview update. [Here](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/inst/shiny) is the repo for the simple implementation of it via more web dev route, from 8 years ago.
